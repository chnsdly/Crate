    <br/>**Mature Manufacturing System**
    <br/>
    Using HDPE as raw material, we employ injection molding with standardized mold platforms. Automated multi-station production with key dimensional tolerance control keeps stacking height and nesting clearance stable. Combined with batch sampling and process monitoring, we ensure continuous and stable mass supply.
    <br/><br/>
    **Rigorous Quality Control**
    <br/>
    Quality assurance covers the full cycle: stacking/compression load, corner drop/impact, handle tensile, detergent & hot-water resistance, weathering & UV aging. Dual validation of structural strength and environmental adaptability ensures safety and durability in high-frequency turnover.
