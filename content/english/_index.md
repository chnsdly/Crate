  # Asia Case (Fresh Distribution & Sorting)
  - name: "刘程"
    image: "images/clients/avater-1.jpg"
    designation: "Operations Manager, South China Fresh Distribution Center"
    content: "The old PP crates often chipped at the corners, causing rework after night-shift stacking. After switching to HDPE mesh crates, stacking is more stable and a warm rinse is enough—drainage is fast. Empty crates can nest for the return trip, so the truck carries more. Damage and top-up replenishment both dropped."

  # Europe Case (Retail RDC & Washing Line)
  - name: "Piotr Kowalski"
    image: "images/clients/avater-2.jpg"
    designation: "Logistics Supervisor, Regional Distribution Center, Poland"
    content: "Our roller and curved conveyors are sensitive to tolerances. These mesh crates have a stiff frame and corners; even four layers don’t sway on the line. On the washing line, 55°C alkaline wash dries fast, so weekend peaks remain on tempo."

  # Africa Case (Fish Sorting & Cold Chain)
  - name: "Samuel Mensah"
    image: "images/clients/avater-3.jpg"
    designation: "Cold-Store Team Lead, Tema Fish Processing, Ghana"
    content: "We handle iced fish in low temperatures, and crates are wet year-round. This HDPE mesh crate stays tough in the cold, handles don’t bite into the hand, and stacks roll steadily on carts. After washing, less water clings and odors don’t linger. Loss rates are lower than before."
